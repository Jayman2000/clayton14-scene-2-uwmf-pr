Scene 2 UWMF is a tool that lets you create levels for
[Wolfenstein 3D](https://www.mobygames.com/game/wolfenstein-3d) on (pretty much)
any modern operating system.

run_for_your_life.tscn is a scene that can be edited using the Godot Engine
editor. It’s made out of many different Tile Nodes. When a Tile Node is
